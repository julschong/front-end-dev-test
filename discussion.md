  1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)
  - I used React and Boostrap because I can modularize the code with React and react-boostrap has some componenets that i can use out of a box.
     
  2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose
  - I ran into problems making the site responsive when I did desktop first approach. After I switched to mobile first with media query, the code got a lot more manageable.
     
  3. What you enjoyed the most and why
  - I really enjoyed trying out things I havent used before. 
     I usually used flexbox for my projects, so I struggled a bit with implementing responsive grid. 
     But, I was able to get it to work after many docs and tutorials.
